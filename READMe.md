code faster. 

There are more that 15 console methods you can use and each of them have their unique cases where
they are applied.

* Console.log("Log a variable or activity")
* Console.info("shows information")
* Console.warn("Shows warning")
* Console.error("displays errors")
* Console.debug("debug")
